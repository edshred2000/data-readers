The file, read_nc_file_struct.m, is a high level NetCDF reader. It will read any NetCDF file inputted.  If the file is properly formatted, CF or another standard format, it will apply offsets and scaling automatically and will replace the fill values with NaNs.  Otherwise you will need to do this manually. This program will output all of the variables in the file into a structure.
